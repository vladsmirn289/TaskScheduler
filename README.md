# Task scheduler

## About
This is a simple scheduler with opportunity choosing a concrete day and create a task, that you
will to complete. A Day in the calendar, that has one or more tasks will be displayed in red. If you change the progress 
of any task to 100 and this day haven't any other tasks, the color of that day will back to normal color.
In addition, you can create repeatable tasks with concrete period (for example, each day or week etc).
